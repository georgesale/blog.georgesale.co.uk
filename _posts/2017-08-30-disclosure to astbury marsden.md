title:  "security disclosure (did not fix) - Astbury Marsden"

Earlier this year, I was approached by a recruiter from another specialist IT, Corporate Risk, and Cyber Security recruitment company - *Astbury Marsden*. I wasn't interested in a job (I'm very happy where I am!) but out of habit, checked their website - only to find a security issue!

Unfortunately, Astbury Marsden wasn't using a secure connection on it's website - exposing personally identifiable information (*user names, emails, cover letters, CVs, telephone numbers, and passwords*) on insecure networks.

As of this post going live, they *still haven't fixed this, despite an initial acknowledgement of the issue and repeated contact*.

This is the second cyber security recruitment company I've blogged about not using a secure connection on their pages, and it's not the last (I have a third disclosure in progress at the moment).

It's now been *187 days* since I initially disclosed this issue to Astbury Marsden and it's not been fixed yet - over twice what my Disclosure Policy says I will publicly disclose after!
